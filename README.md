# PA1-Coupon-Analysis
This study uses visualizations and probability distributions to distinguish between customers who accepted a driving coupon versus those who did not. 
## Data
The data is from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and was collected via a survey on Amazon Mechanical Turk. 
There are five different types of coupons -- less expensive restaurants (under $20), coffee houses, carry out & take away, bar, and more expensive restaurants ($20 - $50).
##  Findings
### Bar Coupons
- 41% of bar coupons were accepted.
- Drivers who go to bar more than once a month tend to accept bar coupons. Drivers who go to bar less than once a month tend to reject bar coupons.
- Drivers who are widowed or in the fishing, farming and forestry industry usually don't go to bars more than once a month. 
- Drivers are more willing to accept bar coupons if there are passengers in the car that are not kids, and they are less likely to accept bar coupons if there are kids in the car.

### More Expensive Restaurant Coupons
-  44% of more expensive restaurant coupons were accepted.
-  How often a driver visits a more expensive restaurant has a strong positive correlation with how likely the driver is going to accept the coupon.
-  Driver's income has no significant impact on more expensive restaurant coupon acceptance rate.
-  People who are widowed and are over the age of 50 are unlikely to accept the coupons to a more expensive restaurant.
-  People are more likely to accept more expensive restaurant coupons when they are driving with their partners and less likely to accept them when they are driving with kids.

## Recommendations
- Businesses that are handing out bar coupons should target drivers that visit bars and have their friends in the car.
- Businesses that are handing out more expensive restaurant coupons has the best chance with drivers who like to dine at nice restaurants and have their partners in the car.
